Loads_1Raw: 
	ERCOT: raw loads from ERCOT in 16 load profiles (including peak and non-peak loads) from 2021 to 2060 in 5-year periods. this data is generated by Houston team (Jin Lu).
	GCAM: raw loads from GCAM in 4 scenarios and 8 load profiles including only non-peak loads for four periods of the year.
	
Loads_2Base_ERCOT (Direct Method): 
	vectorized loads for 25 hours of the day and 123 buses (3075 values). These load files consist of 16 load profiles including peak and non-peak loads for 4 periods of the year. These values are based on Loads_1Raw/ERCOT.

Loads_2Base_ERCOT (GCAM-based):
	vectorized loads for 25 hours of the day and 123 buses (3075). These load files consist of 4 scenarios and 8 load profiles including only non-peak loads for 4 periods of the year. GCAM loads are redistibuted over total annual ERCOT loads. These values are based on Loads_1Raw/GCAM.

Loads_2Base_GCAM:
	vectorized loads for 25 hours of the day and 123 buses (3075). These load files consist of 4 scenarios and 8 load profiles including only non-peak loads for 4 periods of the year. These values are based on Loads_1Raw/GCAM
	
Loads_bus2gen_ERCOT:
	initial load profiles for 2021 for ERCOT including 16 load profiles. these load profiles are used to convert investment results at bus level to generator level.
	
Loads_bus2gen_GCAM:
	initial load profiles for 2021 for GCAM including 8 load profiles. these load profiles are used to convert investment results at bus level to generator level.
